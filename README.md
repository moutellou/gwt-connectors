gwt-connectors
==============

#### Whe are moving from old [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/gwt-connectors/) project page, so much information in the wiki is incomplete. Please, be patient.

A library for drawing connections between shapes on diagrams.

##### Using the library you will be able to:

* Draw connections between shapes.
* Change shape of the connection by dragging its sections.
* Keep shapes connected (glued) while you move them around.
* Add text to connections.
* Add decorations to the connections (such as arrows).

Getting Started
---------------
The [Wiki](https://github.com/robertwaszkowski/gwt-connectors/wiki) contains all the information you'll need to write your own application with drawing connections capabilities.
You can also check sources of our [tester project](tester-webapp), where you should find all what you need.


Reporting Issues
----------------
Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/robertwaszkowski/gwt-connectors/issues) here on Github to report issues. Make sure you read the Getting Help article that walks you through the process or properly reporting an issue.
